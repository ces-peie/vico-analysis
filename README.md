VICo Analysis
=============

If you are analyzing VICo data, or plan to do so, then you are in the right
place. This repository is far from being complete or done but the idea is to
provide resources to help you through your analyses (guides, data
dictionaries, protocols, etc) in addition to sample code and instructions to
get data ready for analysis.

Code for existing analyses will also be hosted here. Feel free to contribute
your code through a [**Pull Request**][new-pull-request]. You can learn [over
here][learn-pull-request] what a **Pull Request** is and how to submit one.

If there is anything that should be here but isn't, let us know by filing an
[**Issue Report**][new-issue].
