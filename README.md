VICo Analysis
=============

If you are analyzing VICo data, or plan to do so, then you are in the right
place. This repository is far from being complete or done but the idea is that
you can find here documents to help you through your analysis (guides, data
dictionaries, protocols, etc) in addition to sample code and instructions to
gain access to the data prepared for analysis.

Code for existing analysis will also be hosted here. Feel free to contribute
your code through a [**Pull Request**][new-pull-request]. You can learn
[here][learn-pull-request] what a **Pull Request** is and how to submit one.

If there is anything that should be here but isn't, let us know by filing a new
[**Issue Report**][new-issue].
